## 👋 About Me

I'm **Nicholas Lawson**, a recent Geography graduate with a passion for GIS, spatial analysis, and health geography. My work focuses on using data-driven maps and statistical tools to inform better planning, public health policy, and urban development. I specialize in ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Python, and spatial modeling (e.g., GWR, service area analysis).

This portfolio includes projects exploring:
- Redefining food deserts in North Texas
- Spatial patterns of liver disease mortality in Texas
- 3D LiDAR-based building estimation in Waco

## 📍 Project 1: Redefining Food Deserts in North Texas

**Objective:**  
To map and redefine food deserts in North Texas by including farmers' markets and ethnic grocery stores.

**Tools:** ArcGIS Pro, USDA SNAP Retailer Locator, CDC PLACES, ACS, Network Analyst  
**Methods:** Network Service Area Analysis, Spatial Join, GWR  
**Outcome:** Expanded definitions reduced food desert areas and improved understanding of underserved zones.

## 📊 Project 2: Spatial Analysis of Liver Disease in Texas

**Objective:**  
To analyze liver disease mortality trends and hotspots in Texas from 2001 to 2020.

**Tools:** ArcGIS Pro, CDC WONDER, County Health Rankings, PLACES  
**Methods:** Hotspot Analysis, Temporal Mapping, GWR  
**Outcome:** Identified mortality hotspots and spatial associations with diabetes, obesity, and Hispanic populations.

## 🏙️ Project 3: LiDAR-Based Small Area Estimation in Waco, TX

**Objective:**  
Use LiDAR data to extract, classify, and quantify buildings in Waco, Texas.

**Tools:** ArcGIS Pro, LAS Dataset  
**Methods:** DTM, DSM, DHM generation, raster-to-polygon, spatial join  
**Outcome:** Estimated building volumes and counts for urban planning.
