## 👋 About Me

I'm **Nicholas Lawson**, a recent Geography graduate with expertise in GIS, spatial analysis, and health geography. I leverage data-driven mapping and statistical modeling to inform public health policy, urban planning, and community development initiatives. 

**Core Competencies:**
- **Software:** ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Python for GIS
- **Analysis:** Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Network Analysis, Hotspot Analysis
- **Specializations:** Health Geography, Urban Planning, LiDAR Processing

This portfolio showcases projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex spatial problems and deliver actionable insights for decision-makers.

## 🍎 Project 1: Redefining Food Deserts in North Texas

**Challenge:** Traditional food desert definitions may overlook alternative food sources, potentially misrepresenting food accessibility in diverse communities.

**Approach:** Comprehensive mapping that includes farmers' markets and ethnic grocery stores alongside traditional supermarkets to provide a more nuanced view of food access.

**Key Tools:** ArcGIS Pro, Network Analyst, USDA SNAP Retailer Locator, CDC PLACES, American Community Survey

**Impact:** Reduced identified food desert areas by 23% and revealed previously hidden food access patterns in Hispanic and Asian communities.

## 🏥 Project 2: Liver Disease Mortality Patterns in Texas

**Challenge:** Understanding the geographic distribution and temporal trends of liver disease mortality to identify at-risk communities.

**Approach:** 20-year spatiotemporal analysis combining mortality data with socioeconomic and health indicators to identify hotspots and risk factors.

**Key Tools:** ArcGIS Pro, CDC WONDER, County Health Rankings, Geographically Weighted Regression

**Impact:** Identified 12 persistent mortality hotspots and quantified relationships between liver disease and diabetes prevalence (R² = 0.67).

## 🏗️ Project 3: LiDAR Building Extraction in Waco, TX

**Challenge:** Accurate building inventory and volume estimation for urban planning without costly field surveys.

**Approach:** Automated building extraction from LiDAR point clouds using digital surface models and machine learning classification techniques.

**Key Tools:** ArcGIS Pro, LAS Dataset Processing, Python scripting

**Impact:** Successfully classified 15,847 buildings with 94% accuracy and generated volume estimates for zoning compliance analysis.
